## A Little About Me
I work for the Disney Conservation team running our sea turtle monitoring program at **Disney's Vero Beach Resort**. I have no experience with coding and am very excited to get started in this program and find ways to apply data science to my current role! Here are three things to know about me:
1. I love all things sci-fi and horror
2. *The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom* is my newest obsession
3. The most recent addition to my family is a 14-week-old Cavalier King Charles Spaniel named Raya
