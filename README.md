## A Little About Me
I work for the Disney Conservation team running our sea turtle monitoring program at **Disney's Vero Beach Resort**. I have no experience with coding and am very excited to get started in this course! Here are three things to know about me:
1. I love all things sci-fi and horror
2. *The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom* is my newest obsession
3. The newest addition to my family is a 14-week Cavalier King Charles Spaniel named Raya
